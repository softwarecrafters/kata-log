## Problem

Imagine being in the 70s when comnputing time was very expensive.
Your team is advised to use the actual computers as less as possible.

## Rules

* You're not allowed to run the code till the end of the kata.
* Syntax checking needs a compiler as well, so please use a text editor (and not an IDE).
