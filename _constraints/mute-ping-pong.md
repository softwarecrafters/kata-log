## How to Play

* Work in pairs (should be a given anyway) 
* Person A only writes tests (test code only)
* Person B only tries to get the tests to pass (production code only)
* Both persons refactor when appropriate
* Both are not allowed to communicate with each other except through code
  * No talking
  * No code comments
  * No magic Strings in code


The goal is to practice writing tests (and code as well) as expressive
as possible.
