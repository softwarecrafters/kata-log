## All the brilliant minds... 

... working together on the same thing, at the same time, in the same
space, and at the same computer.

This practice is being used by teams in production, but can also be
applied to do katas.

Small groups (<= 5 people) tend to find a way on their own to give
everyone a voice - and the keyboard from time to time. Larger groups
sometimes need some facilitation (especially when they don't know each
other). Here are some ideas (you should be familiar with the concepts of
[driver and navigator in pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming)).

## Round Robin

Randomly assign a driver (maybe someone who knows, how to setup an empty
project) and let the keyboard cycle around the group. You could either
set a timer or just pass on after each TDD cycle. If the navigators are
talking "against each other", you might consider to reduce to a single
navigator (e.g. always the person to the right of the keyboard.

## Designated Driver

Have a designated driver for the whole session. The driver is not
allowed to drive on its own, just follow the instructions of the
navigators. This is definitely not a fair distribution between the
roles, but an experienced coder who knows its way through the IDE can
really enable a small team to do some rapid prototyping. (And maybe the
driver may ask a question from time to time.)
