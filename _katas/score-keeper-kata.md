## Problem

We need software to deliver the proper data to the scoreboard for a
basketball team. Unfortunately the people using our software are not
the brightest lights under the sun, so they need six buttons (each team
can score either 1, 2 or 3 points with a single shot).

## Your Task

Write a class `ScoreKeeper` which offers following methods:

    void scoreTeamA1()
    void scoreTeamA2()
    void scoreTeamA3()
    void scoreTeamB1()
    void scoreTeamB2()
    void scoreTeamB3()
    String getScore()

## Rules

The returned String always has seven characters. An example would be
`000:000`

{% include starting_points.md %}
