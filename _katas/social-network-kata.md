## Your Team

Is tired of all those boring tasks like bowling game scores, bank
accounts, singing songs or commanding mars rovers. This time you want to
do something truly innovative: A Social Network!


## Your Rules

Your team also decided for this project to not only apply TDD and 
pair-programming - this time you're gonna use BDD to cover all
important features.
