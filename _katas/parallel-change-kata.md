## Your Task

Change the class `ShoppingCart` in the package `field`.

The class should be handle multiple `int` items instead of a single one.

Tests have already been written.

## Rules

The tests must not be red at any time. No compile-errors, no failures.
(The only exception is for a few seconds while you write a single line of code.)

    languages='C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, Swift'
%}
