## Your Task
Your bank is tired of its mainframe COBOL accounting software and they
hired both of you for a greenfield project in - what a happy coincidence
 - your favorite programming language!

Your task is to show them that your TDD-fu and your new-age programming
language can cope with good oleâ€™ COBOL! 

## Requirements
Write a class `Account` that offers the following methods
   void deposit(int)
   void withdraw(int)
   String printStatement()

An example statement would be:

    Date        Amount  Balance
    24.12.2015   +500      500
    23.8.2016    -100      400
