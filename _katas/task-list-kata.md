## Task List

This is an example of code obsessed with primitives.

A *primitive* is any concept technical in nature, and not relevant to
your business domain. This includes integers, characters, strings, and
collections (lists, sets, maps, etc.), but also things like threads,
readers, writers, parsers, exceptions, and anything else purely
focused on technical concerns. By contrast, the business concepts 
in this project, "task", "project", etc. should be considered part of 
your *domain model*. The domain model is the language of the business 
in which you operate, and using it in your code base helps you avoid 
speaking different languages, helping you to avoid misunderstandings. 
In our experience, misunderstandings are the biggest cause of bugs.

## Exercise

Try implementing the following features, refactoring primitives away as 
you go. Try not to implement any new behaviour until the code you're 
about to change has been completely refactored to remove primitives, 
i.e. **_Only refactor the code you're about to change, then make your 
change. Don't refactor unrelated code._**

One set of criteria to identify when primitives have been removed is to 
only allow primitives in constructor parameter lists, and as local 
variables and private fields. They shouldn't be passed into methods or 
returned from methods. The only exception is true infrastructure 
codeâ€”code that communicates with the terminal, the network, the 
database, etc. Infrastructure requires serialisation to primitives, but 
should be treated as a special case. You could even consider your 
infrastructure as a separate domain, technical in nature, in which 
primitives *are* the domain.

You should try to wrap tests around the behaviour you're refactoring. 
At the beginning, these will mostly be high-level system tests, but you 
should find yourself writing more unit tests as you proceed.

## Features

1. Deadlines
    1. Give each task an optional deadline with the `deadline <ID> <date>` command.
    2. Show all tasks due today with the `today` command.
2. Customisable IDs
    1. Allow the user to specify an identifier that's not a number.
    2. Disallow spaces and special characters from the ID.
3. Deletion
    1. Allow users to delete tasks with the `delete <ID>` command.
4. Views
    1. View tasks by date with the `view by date` command.
    2. View tasks by deadline with the `view by deadline` command.
    3. Don't remove the functionality that allows users to view tasks by project, but change the command to `view by project`.

## Considerations and Approaches

Think about *behaviour attraction*. Quite often, you can reduce the 
amount of behaviour that relies upon primitives from the outside world 
(as opposed to internal primitives stored as private fields or locals) 
simply by moving the behaviour to a *value object* which holds the 
primitives. If you don't have a value object, create one. These value 
objects are known as *behaviour attractors* because once they're 
created, they make it far more obvious where behaviour should live.

A related principle is to consider the type of object you've created. Is 
it a true value object (or *record*), which simply consists of `getFoo` 
methods that return their internal primitives (to be used only with 
infrastructure, of course), or is it an object with behaviour? If it's 
the latter, you should avoid exposing any internal state at all. The 
former should not contain any behaviour. Treating something as both a 
record and an object generally leads to disaster.

Your approach will depend on whether you learn toward a functional or an 
object-oriented style for modelling your domain. Both encourage 
encapsulation, but *information hiding* techniques are generally only 
used in object-oriented code. They also differ in the approach used to 
extract behaviour; functional programming often works with closed sets 
of behaviour through *tagged unions*, whereas in object-oriented code, 
we use *polymorphism* to achieve the same ends in an open, extensible 
manner.

Separate your commands and queries. Tell an object to do something, or 
ask it about something, but don't do both.

Lastly, consider SOLID principles when refactoring:

  * Aim to break large chunks of behaviour into small ones, each with a single responsibility.
  * Think about the dimensions in which it should be easy to extend the application.
  * Don't surprise your callers. Conform to the interface.
  * Segregate behaviour based upon the needs.
  * Depend upon abstractions.
