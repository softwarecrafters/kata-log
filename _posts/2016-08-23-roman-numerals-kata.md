## Your Task

Write a method `String convert(int)` that takes a number and converts it
to the according String representation.

## Examples

       1 ➔ I
       2 ➔ II
       3 ➔ III
       4 ➔ IV
       5 ➔ V
       9 ➔ V
      21 ➔ XXI
      50 ➔ L
     100 ➔ C
     500 ➔ D
    1000 ➔ M
    
## Hint

This kata lures a lot of people to implement features in the order of
the numbers. But do not forget that it's sometimes easier to start
with a general case and add exceptions later.
