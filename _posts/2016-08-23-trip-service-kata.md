## Your Task

The objective is to test and refactor the legacy `TripService` class.
The end result should be well-crafted code that expresses the domain.
We do not need tests for collaborators (right now), we want to test only
the logic contained in the `TripService` class.

## Rules
* **We can't change any existing code if not covered by tests**. We
  can’tafford to break any existing behavior.
* The only exception is if we need to change the code to add unit tests,
  but in this case, **just automated refactorings (via IDE) are allowed**.
