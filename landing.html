                    Good developers are not born but made.
                    And good code doesn't happen by accident but by sweat and tears.
                    The bad news is that a lot of work is needed to become an excellent crafter.
                    The good news is that pretty much anyone can learn it if they're willing to do their homework.
                    Read more about the software craft community and find resources that help
                    you on your way.
